# BBVA Labs - Security

## Who we are

We are security practitioners controlling our paranoia \(sometimes\) and focusing our knowledge and experience to build new security solutions and practices for new \(and old\) IT systems and processes.

## What we do

We research new **security tendencies, techniques and solutions** in Cyber-security issues, especially focused in **SecDevOps** processes with near-future impact in the security of BBVA Group and hopefully in the rest of the world.

## Our projects

We like Open Source and we believe in the **"Don't reinvent the wheel"** mantra.

We create projects that **try to close the gaps** not covered by any other Open Source projects nor commercial solutions yet.

Here you can check our projects. We invite you to use them, test them and ... collaborate. **We welcome contributions!**

### APICheck - The DevSecOps toolset for REST APIs

API-Check is a complete **toolset** designed and created for **testing the REST API**.

API-Check focus not only in the security testing and hacking use cases. The goal of the project is to be a complete toolset for DevSecOPs cycles and for different user profiles:

* Developers
* Systems SysAdmins
* Security & penteters
